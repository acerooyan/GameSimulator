# GameSimulator

This is a program that uses inheritance in Python for creating an animation of different objects which interact with each other. The objects are Hunters, Floaters, Black Holes, Pulsators, Balls, and Special. Each object interacts with each other in a unique way. The Black Holes, Pulsators, and Hunters "eat" the floaters and balls.
